Module 1: Data Description
Goal: 
Body fat percentage, a measure of obesity, plays an important role in various health outcomes such as life expectancy, prognosis for disease, healthcare costs, and the general well-being of individuals. However, accurate measurement of body fat is inconvenient/costly and it is desirable to have easy methods of estimating body fat that are not inconvenient/costly. 

In this module, your group will come up with a simple, robust, accurate and precise  “rule-of-thumb” method to estimate percentage of body fat using clinically available measurements. Your “rule-of-thumb” will be based on a real data set of 252 men with measurements of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements.
