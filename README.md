Thesis Statement:

To accurately estimate bodyfat with clinical measurements, we used several criterions to select important variables. After model diagonsis, we transformed independent variables to better satisfy linear model assumptions. 
We found out that among all 14 variables, the linear function of WEIGHT, WEIGHT transformation, ABDOMEN, FOREARM, and WRIST can best interpret bodyfat.


This Github repository contains all of the data analysis for the mentioned Body Fat data. It is consisted of five main parts: 
* data folder: includes the raw data (raw.csv) and the cleaned data (clean.csv)
* code folder: includes all the code for our analysis
* figure folder: includes all figures/images/tables produced in our analysis
* summary file: a Jupyter Notebook file summary for our analysis
* README Markdown file: a Markdown file briefly summarizing the contents of the repository
